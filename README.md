# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Overview
This project is part of a programming learning journey in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe) JavaScript Full Stack course, focusing on building a Tic Tac Toe game to practice JavaScript and DOM manipulation. The objective is to create an interactive and dynamic game that can be played in the browser.

## Project Overview
The Tic Tac Toe game is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project follows the principles of modular JavaScript and emphasizes organizing code into factories and modules to achieve a clean and maintainable codebase.

## Features
- Dynamic rendering of the game board, player turns, and results using JavaScript.
- Object-oriented approach with factories for GameBoard, Player, and Controllers.
- Implementation of different game modes, including a computer player for single-player mode.
- Responsive design for a seamless gaming experience on various devices.

## Project Structure
The project is structured into several modules to encapsulate different functionalities:
- **GameBoard Module (`GameBoard`):** Manages the state of the game board.
- **Player Factory (`Player`):** Creates player objects with names and marks.
- **Game Controller Module (`GameController`):** Controls the flow of the game and implements game logic.
- **Computer Player Module (`ComputerPlayer`):** Implements logic for the computer player in single-player mode.
- **Display Controller Module (`DisplayController`):** Handles the display and DOM logic for rendering the game board and interacting with players.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (ES6)

## Running the Game
1. Open the live demo in a web browser.
2. Choose game mode (human vs. human or human vs. computer).
3. Click the "Start Game" button.
4. Players take turns clicking on the board to place their marks.
5. The game ends when a player wins or there is a tie.
6. Click the "Restart Game" button to play again.

## Additional Notes
- The project aims to provide a practical application of JavaScript concepts, including modules, factories, and game logic.
- Follows a modular and organized code structure to enhance readability and maintainability.
- Explore the different game modes, including a computer player with varying difficulty levels.
